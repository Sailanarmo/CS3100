# Assignment 2 in Operating Systems

This assignment is the same assignment as [Assignment1](https://github.com/Sailanarmo/CS3100/tree/master/Assignment1). However the difference is the files are split up into individual classes. 

### How to Build

Open your terminal, go into your `build` directory and type the following:
```
cmake .. 
```

This will generate the `Makefile` in order to run the program. Then type `make` in the build directory, and run the same as in Assignment1.
