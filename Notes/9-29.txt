Interprocess Communication (IPC)
	Mechanism
	Communicate & Synchronize
	Two kids of processes
		Independent: Not affected by other processes
		Cooperating: can be affected

	Why?
		Information sharing
		Convenience
		Computation Speed up
		Modularity

Two IPC Operations
	Send(message)
	receive(message)

Types of Links
	Physical: Shared memory, hardware bus, network cable, etc.
	Logical: Buffers, message passing
	
IPC Implementation Issues
	How should the link be established?
	More than two processes?
	How many links between processes?
	Capacity/Bandwidth?
	Fixed or resizabled size messages
	Uni or Bi

Consumer-Producer Paradigm
	Producer: Makes things
	Consumer: Consumes 

Communication Models
	Message Passing
		Generate Msg in Process A
		Copy to Kernel
		Copy to Process B
	
	Shared Memory

Direct Communication
	Link Properties
		one Link
		Established Automatically


Indirect Communication
