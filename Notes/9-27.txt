Process Scheduling
	We want to keep our computer fully utilized.
	Two Types of processes:
		CPU Bound
		I/O Bound
		
	Long Term
		Minutes or More, determines which kinds of processes should be put into the ready queue
			
	Medium Term
		Increase or decrease of degree of multiprogram

	Short Term 
		Decides which process executes next

Context Switch
	CPU Mode
		User->Kernal
		Kernal->User
	Save prcess state
	Pure overhead

Operations on Processes
	Parents create child processes
		Resource Sharing
			Share all resources
			Share a subset
			No Share
		Execution
			Concurrently
			Parent can wait for the child
		Address Space
			Duplicate, this is what fork does
			New address space, this is what execvp does
