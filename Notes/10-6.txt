Multi-Core Development
	Concurrency: Allow progress on more than one task
			
	Parallelism: Progress on more than one simultaneously

Programming Challenges
	Dividing the activities
		What are all the different things that can be done in the system? Or simultaneously
	Balance
		Physics for example
	Data Splitting
	Data Dependencies 
	Testing and Debugging

Types of Parallelism
	Data Parallelism
		
	Task Parallelism

Amdahl's Law
	Speedup <= \frac{1}{S + \frac{(1-S)}{N}}
	
	S - Serial Portion
	N - Number of Processing Cores

	S:25%
		Move from one to two cores = 1.6, which is 60% speedup
