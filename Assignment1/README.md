Assignment 1 Repository to Calculate Fibonacci Sequence, e, and digits of Pi.

This program implements the command line to ask the user for input. The user will have to
run the executable and give 2 arguments. The first argument will be the program they wish
to run. The second argument will be how many iterations, or digits (depending on the program running) the user wishes to execute.

Ex) ./Assign -fib 10

This will execute the program, run the fibonacci version, and execute the fibonacci sequence
10 times.

Options:

	Fibonacci: -fib n [0-40]
	e:         -e   n [0-30]
	Pi:        -pi  n [1-10]

The flag being the program to run, n being the number that you would like to input.

To Compile, simply type 'make' into your command line.
